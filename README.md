# CNN

* CNN (Revised ResNet50) for Chest Cancer Classification | Principles of Computational Intelligence
  * Revised ResNet50 and used it to classify three types of most common chest cancer (Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, and Squamous cell carcinoma) and normal scan
  * Utilized Python, CNN, PyTorch (ResNet50), Transfer Learning, OpenCV, TensorFlow (Keras), NumPy, MatplotLib, Data Augmentation, Average & Max Pooling, Flatten & Dense Layers, Zero padding, Dropout Layers & Early Stopping to avoid Overfitting, Batch Normalization, Adam for Optimizer, Relu & Softmax as activation functions, [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images) for training & evaluation (70% train | 20% test | 10% validation)
